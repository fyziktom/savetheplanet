# Save The Planet and Civilization



Both: Good day everyone.


Z: Many of you have been following our Twitter activities and communications about the Crypto World for the past fourteen days. Thank you for that. At the beginning, we promised to publish an interesting video. We give you contributions and clues as to what the video should be about all the time, and many of you think we will publish a link with PL Framework software in action. Yes, this was the original plan, but we had no idea how big our activity would be and how many people would support us. That's why we've decided to postpone the release of this video and talk to you about something far more important instead. Don't worry, this doesn't mean we're done with our project. On the contrary, we have found another and higher goal.

Z: We live in chaos. Why? Think.

T: The existence of the planet Earth as we know will end if we do not conect together and help. Elon Musk, visioner and leader has also called on the whole world to find an effective solution to capture polution. We think that the solution is the responsibility of all the people on the planet. We are not party of any group, we are only humans who don´t won´t aggression and we just wont all people to be responsible. 

Z: After much thought about this problem, we have created a theory that you see on the board behind us, but it will be better to explain what we mean.

T:Currently, the whole world is trying to solve many problems:
Wars, poverty, hunger, a bad environment, but also a lack of jobs, bad weather, envy, and so on, we could go on. In contrast, one system that is absorbing our planet and us is growing at an incredible rate. These are cryptocurrencies.

T: I'm a technology enthusiast, so I really like the idea of blockchain as a technology, and I even know how to use it in practice.
For most of the history of the human community, people have been willing to kill for gold. Perhaps the saddest example was America, where people killed entire tribes in order to destroy the earth and take out the gold, for which they then stopped respecting each other, became envious, and murdered each other.

T: People have a very short memory, and in connection with the speed of today's world and the fact that people are dealing with immediate benefits rather than long-term stability, history repeats itself to us.

T: Bitcoin is now considered the new gold. And people treat it the same way. Unfortunately, with all the negative aspects that have been in history before. We would love it not to be, but unfortunately we all see what is happening in the cryptocurrency market.

T: But now the situation is worse than ever. The time when one had to see many sunsets before reaching a place where, when looking face to face, he pulled the trigger and killed a man to destroy the earth has now changed insanely, and therefore people do not perceive what they are actually doing in their modern gold rush. Today, they just buy 5 super powerful graphics cards and discard the old ones. Whenever they do this, they usually unknowingly plunder the planet so that people die at the other end. However, the face-to-face look of those who kill in this way is missing, so they don't realize it and that's why it still persists.

Z: Let us realize how many cryptocurrencies there are now and what their real purpose is. For more than 80% of them, it's just to drive the price up and turn others for money. Abuse their naivety no matter what it causes the planet and the organisms live on it. This is looks like of the situation in the Czech Republic in the 1990s, when coupon privatization took place here. Many people lost their life savings, many people got into existential problems, many people were killed because of money, businesses went bankrupt, which still fall into disrepair and burden their neighborhood. The extreme negative impact was also the loss of confidence in a great stock investment tool, which was supposed to help rebuild our industry and send us to the forefront. Instead, people lost confidence, feared, and delayed industrial development by at least 10 years. And this whole thing happened not only in the Czech Republic, but in many other places in the world.

T: Blockchain is an amazing technology, the idea is revolutionary. However, it has degenerated due to human greed, and because of this, most people today are very concerned about its introduction and use. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the past. We need to show people that this is a great technology that can help us all in the long run. Even a very fast express can be braked and redirected to a better track.

T:We believe that in a few months of quality analyzes, we can declare at least 80% of cryptocurrencies unnecessary. People will stop mining, buying, stacking, etc. This will reduce the sales of graphics cards, gold diggers and fanatics and will be able to use them by industrial companies that employ millions of people, hospitals that need powerful graphics cards for CT, MRI, PET, etc. People stop buying newer and newer computers unnecessarily every year, just to make money faster and faster.

Z: We now challenge the leaders and the smartest minds in the world. Please join a quality analytical team that goes through as many cryptocurrencies that now exist. Let's look at their technology, let's look at their team, let's look at their visions, let's look their positive impact on global society. Let's save and support those who make sense and have a good impact on our planet. Let's keep the ones that are somewhat useful and supported, those that have a history and that are beneficial. Let's keep Bitcoin, which has strength and stability, let's keep Dodge, which is popular in the world, let's keep NEBL, which is technologically well prepared for real use for it in practice on PL Framework, and let's find at least 3 more that we will keep and start using for the greater good.

T: Developments in the market over the last 14 days have shown us how much power an individual has. sharing Doge and Elon Musk and how this person can affect the world. When other leaders join him, such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and others who have promised to give away half of their assets in their lifetime, why not do it here. Let us financially support projects that make sense that will enable us to save our economy, reduce the use of silicon, reduce CO2 emissions and waste, and thus protect the environment and the future of our planet and our descendants. Already today, you can pay with BitCoin in many places. So why not expand this technology and change the market. Let us remove the need for paper currency, which is destroying the market, and choose cryptocurrencies that we can use as new currency even across the solar system. Due to economic difficulties, today more than 90% of the population is taught to pay with electronic currency, so why not cryptocurrency. 

Z: We like the idea of a society without borders and, above all, without unnecessary bureaucracy and regulations. We like an interconnected world and a world of people who are not afraid to act freely, as the WallStreetBets initiative has shown. But let's hold on, not everyone can accept this so quickly, so let's give them time and prepare them. Let us involve governments and give them the opportunity to change this over the next two years.

Z: What do you think about that?
T: Let save our planet, organisms, civilization and system.
If you agree with this vision, please contact us next week.


T: As has been said Stan Lee, "With great power there must also come -- great responsibility."

Both: Thank you :)
